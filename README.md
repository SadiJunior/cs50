# cs50

Harvard University offers an introductory course on Computer Science called **CS50**.
In 2023, I've been attending to the online classes, available [here (CS50 2023)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).
It's also available on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

I will be adding all the activities done througout the CS50 course to this repository.

The course is divided in 10 weeks, each one focusing on a different computation knowledge:

0. Week 0: Introduction and Scratch
1. Week 1: C
2. Week 2: Arrays and Introduction to Algorithms
3. Week 3: Algorithms
4. Week 4: Memory
5. Week 5: Data Structures
6. Week 6: Python
7. Week 7: SQL
8. Week 8: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
9. Week 9: Flask
10. Week 10: Emoji

Actually, Harvard University has a series of CS50 courses, that get into speficic areas of Computer Science.
