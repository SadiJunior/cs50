If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
R: By getting the average of the danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness and valence columns, and aplying some sort of algorithm that would get the audio aurea from this data.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
R: Arguably, songs have much more complex feelings embeded in them, and if we keep on finding characteristics, we would have to add a lot of complexity to our databases and algorithms.
